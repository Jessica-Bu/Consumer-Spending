# Consumer-Spending

The main question of this project was:

How has consumer spending changed in the past 10 years?


Why is that interesting?

Because our economy has faced major shifts especially in the past 5 years:
- Inflation
- Income distribution
- Consumer values
- Consumer spending


Why is this relevant?

Because all kinds of companies face these shifts and need to find strategies to navegate through the new landscape.
